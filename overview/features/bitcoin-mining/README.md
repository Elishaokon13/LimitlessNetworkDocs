# 1️⃣ Bitcoin Mining

Our mining operations utilize cutting-edge technology to ensure efficient and sustainable Bitcoin extraction. By leveraging renewable energy sources, Limitless Network minimizes environmental impact while maintaining high performance.&#x20;

In the early days, Bitcoin mining was accessible to anyone with a personal computer, but right now cryptocurrency mining it’s a daunting task. That’s why, through a transparent infrastructure and an open community, we empower even those with no experience to yield from our mining operations by simply holding LNT tokens.

During Bitcoin's first year in 2009, mining difficulty was low, reflecting the limited number of miners and the network's emerging state. As a result, miners could solve puzzles more easily and earn significant rewards. The first block, known as the "genesis block," awarded 50 bitcoins, and early miners often mined multiple blocks daily, amassing substantial amounts of Bitcoin at a time when its value was negligible. As Bitcoin's popularity grew, so did the complexity of mining. Enthusiasts began optimizing their processes by experimenting with more powerful hardware such as GPUs and eventually ASICs.
