# ðŸ˜“ Problem Statement

Bitcoin mining and trading can be resource-intensive and require significant expertise. Many investors lack the means to participate directly in these activities, missing out on potential profits. The high cost of ASIC hardware is by far the biggest challenge for small-scale miners, which makes it difficult for individuals to compete with industrial mining operations. As well as the high cost of hardware required to mine Bitcoin, successful mining requires technical know-how to manage hardware, optimise performance and ensure efficiency.  &#x20;

On the trading aspect, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and unpredictable and can pose a significant challenge, especially with a huge data overload, where the vast amount of market data could overwhelm manual trades.
