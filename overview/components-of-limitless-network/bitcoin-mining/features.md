# Features

This demand for more powerful ASIC hardware which consumes a lot of electricity has made Limitless Network look for solutions and right now, we are taking steps towards integrating solar power into our operations. By harnessing the energy of the sun, we are not only reducing our carbon footprint but also diversifying our energy sources. This forward-thinking approach not only aligns with the global push towards renewable energy but also helps to future-proof the facility against potential fluctuations in energy prices.

Imagine a Bitcoin mining facility that combines low kilowatt-hour (kWh) rates with a forward-thinking approach towards sustainable energy. This facility is paving the way for a greener and more cost-effective future in the world of cryptocurrency mining.

With our strategic geographic location in North America which provides low kWh rates, our mining facility can significantly reduce the operational costs associated with Bitcoin mining. By accessing affordable electricity, miners can maximize their profits and increase their mining capabilities.&#x20;

\


Limitless Network utilises high-efficiency AntMiner S19 Pro ASIC miners and advanced AI algorithms to optimize Bitcoin mining and trading. Our ASICs are tailored for specific algorithms, such as Bitcoin's SHA-256, offering unmatched speed and energy efficiency compared to general-purpose hardware. This allows our ASICs miners to outperform CPUs and GPUs, processing more hashes per second and reducing energy consumption. While the initial investment in ASIC hardware can be substantial, their efficiency translates to lower electricity costs and higher profitability in the long run. Miners using ASICs can achieve a faster return on investment due to increased mining output. By integrating these operations at Limitless Network, we maximised the efficiency and profitability of our machines and so far we have distributed _30.88 BNB (approx $19k)_ dividends to token holders.
